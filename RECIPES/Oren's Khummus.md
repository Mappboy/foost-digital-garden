## 📝 Directions
1. Play some beautiful music to keep you moving through the process. Nothing beats good live radio. Or a record.
2. Wash chickpeas thoroughly under cold water and and soak overnight in a bowl (12hrs)
3. Go to sleep.
4. Wake up, have a nice coffee and greet your neighbour. Play some great music and get into it.
5. Drain and rinse the chickpeas
6. Place chickpeas in large pot, fill with water and bring to boil.
7. Lower the heat, drain water and replace with freshly boiled water from a kettle.(Some khummus purists argue that draining the cooking water take away some of the flavour. I’m not really sure why I’m doing it other than habit, and the fact clear water help me see the floating jackets more easily and remove them, and watch that the garlic is not disintegrating).
8. Peel the garlic and chuck it in the pot.
9. Remove any floating jackets (skins)
10. After about 2 hours of cooking check to see if chickpeas are soft by gently squeezing a chickpea between your thumb and index finger. (depending on the type of chickpeas used, time of cooking changes. Generally speaking, smaller chickpeas take longer to cook, sometimes up to 4 hours if not using a pressure cooker. I use a stainless steel pot and large chickpeas. It takes 2 hours.
11. Once softness achieved, drain water into a small pot, place chickpeas and garlic in a bowl and leave to cool on the bench for 10 minutes
12. Squeeze some lemons and do a little dance. It’s your favourite song.
13. Cover chickpeas with cooking water, lemon juice, oil and spices. Stir and use a stick mixer until reaching uniform consistency.
14. Add the tahini and stir enthusiastically. Using a whisker head on the stick mixer makes life easier. You can still use a whisk enthusiastically, however, you might end up with hummus all over your kitchen. Remember to wait until it stops spinning before taking it out of the bowl.
15. Whisk until desired consistency reached.
16. If too thick, add water. If too thin, add tahini. Check for flavour. Use your finger. (If it’s clean)

Congrats. You made it. Clean up your mess and take a short break before the Zkhug
